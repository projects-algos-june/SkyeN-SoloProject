My solo project will be a of an e-commerce site for a single product and make use of WebGL to display a 3D model
of the object and allow for customizations to a purchase. This will be accomplished by use of the Sketchfab API (MVP)
or Three.js (product backlog).

The site will also include a customer database with login and registration for tracking customer shipping and payment info using Django/Python (MVP),
with possible inclusion of the Square API (product backlog).

MVP:
- E-commerce site for single product displayed using Sketchfab API (javascript) for customizations and viewing
- Login/Registration and pseudo-payment processing using Django/Python

Product Backlog:
- Use of Three.js for product WebGL display and customization
- User of Square API (python) for login/registration/payment processing
